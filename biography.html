                        Village.As a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs." His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey

                        stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: "When my dad and I
                        would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he
                        knew how." Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and "making a thousand
                        phone calls in pursuit of drugs".</p>
